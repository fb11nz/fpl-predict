This repositories hosts an assortment of tools used for DevOps purposes.

### Stale repositories
The workflow `.github/workflows/state_repos.yml` identifies and reports repositories with no activity for a configurable amount of time (currently set at 365 days). A repository is considered inactive if it has not had a `push` action.

There are exceptions to this rule, such as our repositories that house binaries. The contents of these repositories are frequently cloned and pulled, but there may not be active development on them for extended periods of time.
