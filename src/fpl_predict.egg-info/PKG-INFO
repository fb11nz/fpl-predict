## Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Data Sources & Ingestion

The system ingests data from multiple sources:

- **FPL API** (`bootstrap-static`): Player stats, fixtures, teams
  - Current season player data (prices, ownership, form)
  - Fixture list with home/away teams
  - Team metadata and strength ratings

- **Football-Data.org**: Historical match results
  - Past match scores and statistics
  - Used for team strength calculations

- **Web Scraping**: Recent transfer detection
  - Scrapes Premier League, Sky Sports, BBC for transfers
  - Applies time-based penalties to newly transferred players

### 2. Preprocessing Pipeline

Data flows through several preprocessing steps:

1. **Feature Engineering** (`build_features.py`):
   - Aggregates last N games statistics
   - Calculates rolling averages and form metrics
   - Merges FPL and external data sources

2. **Team Strength Calculation**:
   - Uses historical results to compute team offensive/defensive ratings
   - Adjusts for home/away performance

3. **Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR)**:
   - Combines official FPL FDR with computed team strengths
   - Creates custom difficulty metrics

### 3. Model Training

The system trains multiple specialized models:

#### Basic Models (default):
- **Linear Regression**: Simple baseline predictions
- **Random Forest**: Non-linear patterns

#### Advanced Models (`--advanced` flag):
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting for complex patterns
- **LightGBM**: Fast gradient boosting
- **Ensemble**: Weighted average of multiple models

#### Prediction Targets:
- **Expected Points (EP)**: Total points prediction
  - `ep_base`: Raw model prediction
  - `ep_blend`: 50/50 blend with FPL's official EP
  - `ep_adjusted`: Post-processed with competition/transfer adjustments

- **Expected Minutes (xMins)**: Playing time prediction (0-90)
  - Critical for identifying rotation risks
  - Post-processed for backup players

- **Clean Sheets (CS)**: Probability of defensive returns
  - Separate models for GKP/DEF

- **Expected Goal Involvement (xGI)**: Goals + Assists prediction

### 4. Post-Processing Pipeline

After training, several adjustments are applied:

1. **Backup Player Detection** (`fix_squad_roles_post_training`):
   - Identifies backup GKPs (ownership < 2%, price < £5.0m)
   - Sets their xMins to 0

2. **Competition Detection** (`competition_detector.py`):
   - Data-driven approach using:
     - Ownership percentages
     - Player prices
     - Position depth at each club
   - Reduces xMins for players with competition

3. **Recent Transfer Adjustments** (`recent_transfers.py`):
   - Web scrapes for transfers in last 14 days
   - Applies penalties:
     - 0-3 days: 80% of original xMins
     - 4-7 days: 65% of original xMins
     - 8-14 days: 40% of original xMins

4. **New Player Adjustments** (`adjustments.py`):
   - Prevents harsh penalties for players with limited minutes (<180 mins)
   - Sets minimum floor at 60% of position average for same price bracket
   - Ensures new signings aren't unfairly penalized

5. **EP Recalculation**:
   - After xMins adjustments, recalculates `ep_adjusted`
   - Ensures consistency between playing time and points

### 5. Squad Optimization

The Linear Programming optimizer (`optimizer.py`) solves:

#### Objective Function:
Maximize: Σ(EP × captain_multiplier + value_bonus + difficulty_bonus - risk_penalty)

#### Constraints:
- **Budget**: Total cost ≤ £100m
- **Squad Composition**: Exactly 2 GKP, 5 DEF, 5 MID, 3 FWD
- **Club Limit**: Max 3 players per club
- **Formation**: Valid formation for starting XI
- **Bench Budget**: Bench players cost ≤ specified budget

#### Key Features:
- **Two-Stage Optimization**: Evaluates transfers then optimizes lineup
- **Formation Flexibility**: Automatically selects optimal formation
- **Captain/Vice-Captain Selection**: Identifies best captain and vice-captain choices
- **Bench Optimization**: Orders bench by expected points
- **Banking Strategy**: Compares immediate transfers vs saving for multiple transfers (up to 5 FT)
- **Multi-horizon Planning**: Considers future fixtures

### 6. Integration & Automation

The entire pipeline is integrated via `update_weekly.py`:

1. **Data Update**: Fetches latest FPL/external data
2. **Feature Engineering**: Rebuilds features with new data
3. **Model Training**: Retrains all models
4. **Post-Processing**: Applies all adjustments automatically
5. **Saves Results**: Outputs ready for optimizer

Running `fpl update --run` triggers the complete pipeline, ensuring all fixes and adjustments are applied without manual intervention.

## Model Performance

The system uses cross-validation to evaluate models:
- Expected Points: MAE ~2.5 points
- Minutes Prediction: Accuracy ~85% for starters
- Clean Sheets: AUC-ROC ~0.72

## Recent Updates

### Free Hit Team Generator (New!)
- **Complete 15-Man Squads**: Generates full starting XI + bench with legal formations
- **Budget Optimization**: Uses your actual squad selling value (not hardcoded £100m)
- **Upgrade Algorithm**: Iteratively improves squad to maximize quality with remaining budget
- **Smart Captaincy**: Recommends captain + vice-captain using haul factor
  - Prioritizes high-ceiling players (FWD 1.8x, MID 1.5x, DEF 0.9x, GKP 0.6x)
- **Fixture Analysis**: Compare Free Hit value across all gameweeks with EP deltas

### Chip Strategy Improvements
- **2025/26 Double Chips**: Plans optimal usage of 8 chips (2 sets of TC/BB/FH/WC)
- **Fixture-Based EP**: Per-gameweek predictions using FDR and home/away adjustments
- **Urgency Tracking**: H1 chips (GW1-19) have deadline pressure, H2 saved for DGWs
- **FDR Bug Fix**: Corrected inverted FDR multiplier (low FDR now correctly = easier fixture)
- **Personalized Analysis**: Based on your actual owned players, not generic top scorers

### Transfer Recommender Enhancements
- **Lineup Optimization**: Recommends optimal starting XI with captain/vice-captain
- **Banking Strategy**: Compares making transfers now vs banking for next week
- **FPL 5 FT Cap**: Updated to reflect FPL's current 5 free transfer maximum (was 2)
- **New Player Adjustments**: Smart handling of players with limited data (<180 mins)

### System Improvements
The system automatically handles:
- Players who recently transferred clubs (via web scraping)
- Backup goalkeepers and rotation risks
- New signings who need time to settle
- Banking decisions for up to 5 free transfers
- Max 3 players per club constraint in all optimizations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

```bash
# Authentication (required for myteam features)
FPL_AUTH_TOKEN=your_token_here    # From browser DevTools

# Optional
FPL_ENTRY_ID=5436936              # Your team ID
FPL_EMAIL=your_email              # For password login
FPL_PASSWORD=your_password        # For password login
FOOTBALL_DATA_TOKEN=api_token     # For historical data

# Behavior toggles
ALLOW_RULES_FALLBACK=true        # Use rule-based models as fallback
ALLOW_ODDS_FALLBACK=true         # Use odds data if available
```

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Ensure token includes "Bearer " prefix or is just the token value
- Token expires after ~1 hour, refresh from browser
- Check .env file is in project root

### Model Training Issues
- Run with `--rebuild-features` if data seems stale
- Use `--rebuild-models` to force retrain
- Check `data/processed/` for intermediate files

### Optimizer Issues
- Ensure models trained successfully first
- Check bench budget is reasonable (150-200 = £15-20m)
- Verify no impossible constraints (e.g., excluding too many players)

### Free Hit Team Generator Issues
- **"No valid formation found"**: Usually due to budget constraints or missing fixture data
  - Run `fpl update --run` to ensure latest data
  - Check your squad value with `fpl myteam sync --entry YOUR_ID`
- **Budget seems wrong**: Free Hit uses your squad's selling value (not buying price)
  - Selling value = what you'd get if you sold all players now
  - Check `data/processed/myteam_latest.json` for selling prices
- **Team seems suboptimal**: Analysis uses fixture-based EP predictions
  - EP varies by opponent and home/away status
  - Use `fpl chips free-hit-analysis` to see EP for each gameweek
